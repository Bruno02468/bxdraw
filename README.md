# bxdraw
Multi-user real-time drawing made simple.

## CURRENTLY NOT RUNNABLE, IT'S A WORK-IN-PROGRESS.
## WILL REMOVE THIS WHEN IT'S ABLE TO BE RUN.
## I'M JUST UPLOADING TO GITHUB SO IT GETS SAVED.

To run, just clone the repository, then install the required modules by running "npm install" in the base folder of the working copy.

To start the thing, which runs by default on port 9999, run "node server.js".

That process logs stuff, so make sure to redirect its stdout to /dev/null, a log file, or something like that.
