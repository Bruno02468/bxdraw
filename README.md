# bxdraw, a work-in-progress
Multi-user real-time drawing made simple.

Setup: just clone the repository, then install the required modules by running "npm install" in the base folder of the working copy.

To start the thing, which runs by default on port 9999, run "node server.js".

Settings? Edit the vars at the top of server.js and public/draw.js until I make an actual config file or something.

That's pretty much it. More cool features to come, maybe.
